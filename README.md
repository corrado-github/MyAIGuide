# MyAIGuide

Our aim is to create AI-based health coaches through crowdsourced health research.<br/>

Here is the <a href='./data/raw/ParticipantData' target='_blank'>open-sourced data</a> gathered through <a href='https://myaiguide.org/' target='_blank'>our web application</a>. 

We use <a href='https://medium.com/@oliviermirat/crowdsourcing-health-research-a-new-chance-for-patients-and-tech-people-8658ae298254' target='_blank'>crowdsourcing</a> to investigate the difficult yet very important problem faced by patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome and other chronic pain syndromes of <a href='https://www.painscience.com/articles/art-of-rest.php' target='_blank'>finding the right balance between rest and exercise</a>.

Our first <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368539250_Big_personal_data_points_to_physical_strain_causing_pain_in_the_short_and_long_term_in_some_chronic_pain_patients' target='_blank'>pre-print publication</a> is out. The scripts used for that publication can be found <a href='./scripts' target='_blank'>here</a>.
